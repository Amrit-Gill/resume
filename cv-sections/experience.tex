\begin{cventries}

\cventry
{Design \& Development Engineer: Electrical Grid Monitoring}
{Power Application Department, NetCeler}
{Valence, France}
{Septembre 2015 - Present}
{
\begin{cvitems}
\item {IVPower is a  software dedicated to real time monitoring and analysis of electrical disturbances and power quality in transmission and distribution grid. The role of a design and development engineer is to develop mathematical models to treat records available in COMTRADE and PQDIF formats.}
\item {Implemented automatic fault analysis algorithms using Matlab and integrated them to Java at the backend using Matlab Builder JA}
\item {Automated Matlab compilation using Maven}
\item {Intensive use of signal processing tools}
\end{cvitems}
}

\cventry
{Intern: Probabilistic Load Flow}
{EDF R\&D France}
{Clamart, France}
{February 2015 - August 2015}
{
\begin{cvitems}
\item {The objective of the internship was to develop the models and statistical tools
for the simulation and prediction of system's state in the presence of hazards such as varying electrical consumption and unavailability of network equipment using Three Point estimation method.Monte-Carlo probabilistic load flow method is used for the comparison of results. Most of the work is performed in PowerFactory (Power system simulation tool from DigSILENT)}
\item {Acquired knowledge of electrical network modeling and simulation}
\item {DigSilent programing language to communicate (data acquisition and update) with grid objects}
\item {Implemented probabilistic load flow algorithms using Python}
\end{cvitems}
}

\cventry
{Intern: Load Flow Studies for Distribution Grid}
{G2ELab}
{Saint martin d'here, France}
{June 2014 - July 2014}
{%
\begin{cvitems}
\item {Load flow and flexibility studies for unbalanced electrical distribution network using Forward/Backward sweep method. The results of this internship were compared with other well known load flow algorithms such as Newton-Raphson method and proved to be accurate in case of high unbalance in phase currents}
\item {Implimented using Matlab}
\end{cvitems} 
}

\cventry
{Intern: Study of Fe-Ni based hard magnetic materials}
{Consortium de Recherche pour l'Emergence de Technologies Avanc√©es, CNRS}
{Grenoble, France}
{February 2013 - July 2013}
{%
\begin{cvitems}
\item {Objective: To explore Magneto-caloric and super-conductive properties of Fe-Ni based hard magnetic materials using high temperature annealing and mechanical deformation}
\end{cvitems} 
}

\cventry
{Summer School: Fabrication and characterisation of a solar-panel}
{MINATECH}
{Grenoble, France}
{Summer 2012}
{%
